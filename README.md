This system allows common questions to be answered faster and allow everyone to learn something. Our website is a fun, and is a interactive way to encourage learning outside the classroom. Our mission is one that is simple. As we are students and have friends older and younger, we know and see kids struggle in math class. Our mission is not to teach math as many other websites do, but make it easier make it fun, to allow that one test to be a breeze. We want to share what makes us good at math and show its just a series of tricks. We are not human calculators but humans who struggle. Our mission is to make everyone's math grade go to infinity and beyond.

We've used HTML and CSS for designing this website, along with some referenced JS to make the site dynamic and functional. We've made a login page through which the user could access the content that our experts have to provide. The portal that users are directed to will give them full access to all the resources that's been prepared for them.
